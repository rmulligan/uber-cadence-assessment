2. **Community Resources**: GitHub organization well-structured with examples
3. **Development Experience**: Go client APIs intuitive and well-designed
4. **Debugging Tools**: Web UI essential for understanding workflow behavior

### Learning Curve Observations
1. **Initial Setup**: Docker configuration required troubleshooting
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Understanding signal channels took time
3. **Child Workflow Lifecycle**: Required studying existing examples
4. **Activity Design**: Balancing granularity vs. simplicity

### Time Breakdown (Total: ~3 hours)
- **Environment Setup**: 30 minutes
- **Pattern Study**: 45 minutes  
- **Implementation**: 60 minutes
- **Testing & Documentation**: 45 minutes

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Assessment Clarity

#### Current Challenge
> "Wait for a signal from the restaurant to accept or reject the order"

#### Suggested Improvement
```
Wait for a signal on channel "restaurant-decision" with payload:
- "accept" - proceed with order
- "reject" - terminate workflow with appropriate message

Expected signal format: string value ("accept" or "reject")
```

#### Benefit
- Reduces ambiguity in signal implementation
- Ensures consistent evaluation across candidates
- Prevents time loss on signal format guessing

### 2. Sample Data Standardization

#### Current Challenge
Random UUIDs create inconsistent test scenarios

#### Suggested Improvement
```go
// Provide sample test data
testOrder := Order{
    ID: "order-12345",
    Content: []string{"cheeseburger", "diet coke", "fries"},
}
testUserID := "user-67890"
testRestaurantID := "restaurant-abc123"
```

#### Benefit
- Consistent demo experiences
- Easier evaluation comparison
- Simplified testing procedures

### 3. Evaluation Rubric

#### Suggested Improvement
```bash
# Provide pre-configured environment
make setup-assessment
# Automated port detection and conflict resolution
# Health checks for all services
# Smoke test execution
```

### 6. Guided Learning Resources

#### Suggested Addition
```
Pre-Assessment Learning Path:
1. Cadence Quickstart (15 min)
2. Go Client Tutorial (30 min)  
3. Signal Handling Example (15 min)
4. Child Workflow Pattern (15 min)

Estimated prep time: 75 minutes
```

## Platform-Specific Feedback

### Cadence Strengths Discovered
1. **Developer Experience**: Go APIs feel natural and intuitive
2. **Observability**: Web UI provides excellent workflow visibility
3. **Durability**: Signal handling demonstrates state persistence
4. **Scalability**: Worker model shows clear scaling path

### Areas for Platform Improvement
1. **Error Messages**: Some timeout errors could be more descriptive
2. **Local Development**: Docker setup could be more streamlined
3. **Documentation**: More real-world examples beyond samples
